The page provided below is a game which each client has two chance in a day to participate in it.
An API must be implemented inorder to verify the word and remaining chances using client IP address.
Please use Nextjs & SCSS to implement the client & server side / API. ( Don't use any external database )
Each request from the client side must be logged in detail to console only if the currently running enviroment is dev. ( use axios interceptors )


Tips & Tricks:
1. https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
2. https://github.com/axios/axios
3. https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors
4. Your api services must follow OOP as much as possible ( client side )
5. Create components for each unit in the page ( header, footer, buttons, modal, ... )
6. Don't use redux, instead you can use react context if you wish.
